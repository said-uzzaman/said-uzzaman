# Hi there, I'm Md Saiduzzaman 👋

## 🎓 About Me

I'm a **Graduate Research Assistant** in the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering at **Missouri University of Science & Technology**, working under the guidance of **Dr. Bong-Chul Seo**. My research focuses on advancing hydrological modeling frameworks, particularly in the areas of channel routing, and streamflow assimilation.

🔬 **Currently seeking PhD opportunities** in Water Resources Engineering, Hydrologic & hydraulic Modeling, and Channel Routing.

- **Hydrological Modeling** - Distributed watershed modeling, rainfall-runoff processes
- **Channel Routing** - hydrologic & hydraulic routing
- **Data Assimilation** - Integration of observational data into channel routing module
- **Flood Forecasting** - Real-time prediction systems, early warning systems

## 💼 Current Research

### Comparative Assessment of the NWM Channel Routing Models for Enhanced Streamflow Data Assimilation

I am currently conducting a **comprehensive evaluation of the channel routing module (T-Route: Tree-Based Channel Routing)** and implementing **data assimilation within the diffusive wave method** as part of the **NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework**.

**Research Focus:**
- Modified the current routing structure of the channel routing module (T-Route) of the NextGen National Water Model (NWM)
- Assessed the new hydraulic channel routing method (i.e., diffusive wave routing) included in T-Route, compared with the capabilities of the current operational routing method in the NWM (i.e., Muskingum–Cunge routing)
- Implementing streamflow data assimilation (DA) in diffusive wave routing and demonstration of its operational capabilities using an extensive network of streamflow observations

**Technical Modifications in T-Route:**
-  Developed a **catchment file processing pipeline** using parallelized I/O with `joblib` to read `cat-*.csv` outputs directly from ngen, replacing the previous nexus-based lateral flow ingestion
-  Redesigned **gage-to-segment mapping** by deriving the crosswalk directly from `flowpaths`, bypassing hydrosequence-based filtering to support flowpath-level DA
