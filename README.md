# Hi there, I'm Md Saiduzzaman 👋

## 🎓 About Me

I'm a **Graduate Research Assistant** in the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering at **Missouri University of Science & Technology**, working under the guidance of **Dr. Bong-Chul Seo**. My research focuses on advancing hydrological modeling frameworks, particularly in the areas of distributed hydrological modeling, channel routing, and streamflow assimilation.

🔬 **Currently seeking PhD opportunities** in Water Resources Engineering, Hydrological Modeling, and Channel Routing.

## 💼 Current Research

### Comparative Assessment of the NWM Channel Routing Models for Enhanced Streamflow Data Assimilation

I am currently conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the channel routing module (**T-Route: Tree-Based Channel Routing**) and implementing data assimilation within the diffusive wave method as part of the **NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework**. I have developed significant modifications to T-Route.

**Key Modifications:**
- ✅ Implemented **flowpath-level lateral flow support** for fine-scale routing
- ✅ Enhanced data assimilation capabilities with direct gage-to-flowpath mapping
- ✅ Integrated with **NextGen in a Box** for containerized deployment

**Impact:** Enables higher spatial resolution routing, improved accuracy in streamflow predictions, and better integration with NOAA's operational forecasting systems.
